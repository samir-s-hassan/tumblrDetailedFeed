# Project 6 - Tumblr v2.0

Submitted by: Samir Hassan

Tumblr is an app that fetches a feed of blog posts from the Tumblr API and displays them in a scrolling list via a table view. The app can be easily configured to fetch the blog posts from any other Tumblr blog. I'm using the Tumblr humansofnewyork blog to show on my feed. I also have a detailed view for every Tumblr post.
Tumblr facilitates seamless navigation to detailed content, enhances user experience through a polished Detailed View UI, enables data transfer to the Detailed View Controller, and includes my own personalized touches to refine the overall interface.

## Notes

No challenges were encountered while building this app. It was a good idea though to use a UITextView instead of a UILabel to support super long text.
